                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    Arthur Samuel, a pioneer of Computer Science, defined
                    Machine Learning as the sub-field of Computer Science that
                    "gives computers the ability to learn without being
                    explicitly programmed"
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 3 main types of Machine Learning algorithms:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#introduction-supervisedlearning">
                            Supervised Learning
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#introduction-unsupervisedlearning">
                            Unsupervised Learning
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#introduction-reinforcementlearning">
                            Reinforcement Learning
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="introduction-supervisedlearning">
                    1) Supervised Learning
                </h3>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>
                    We give the algorithm a bunch of photos.<br />
                    We also point out the human faces in the photos to the
                    algorithm.<br />
                    The algorithm is then given new photos (that it has never
                    seen before).<br />
                    The algorithm points out the human faces in the new photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <em>supervised learning</em>, the algorithm is trained using
                    labeled data.<br />
                    Then, the algorithm can label unlabeled data.
                </p>

                <h3 id="introduction-unsupervisedlearning">
                    2) Unsupervised Learning
                </h3>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>
                    We give the algorithm a bunch of photos, and nothing
                    else.<br />
                    The algorithm looks for patterns in the photos, and invents
                    groups.<br />
                    Examples of groups: photos containing humans faces; photos
                    of ducks; and black and white photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <em>unsupervised learning</em>, the algorithm finds
                    patterns in the provided data, and invents groups. This
                    grouping of data is known as called "clustering", and the
                    formed groups are called "clusters".
                </p>

                <h3 id="introduction-reinforcementlearning">
                    3) Reinforcement Learning
                </h3>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>
                    We give the algorithm an encoding of a chess game.<br />
                    The algorithm is also given a function that measures how well
                    it's doing in the chess game.<br />
                    The algorithm spits out an effective sequence of chess
                    moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <em>reinforcement learning</em>, the algorithm is given
                    an encoding of some system, and a function that measures the
                    algorithm's performance in the system. The algorithm uses
                    the given encoding and function to figure out the (almost)
                    best sequence of actions to take.

                    Hello, my name is Nim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took a poorly-taught course on
                    Machine Learning in my third year of university. But why sit
                    and complain when I could just self-teach the subject while
                    putting together this tutorial.
