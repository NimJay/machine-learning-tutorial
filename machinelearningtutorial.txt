What is Machine Learning?
A pioneer of Computer Science named Arthur Samuel defines Machine Learning as
the subfield of Computer Science that "gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed".


There are 3 main types of algorithms in Machine Algorithms:
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning


1) Supervised Learning --------------------------

example -----
We give the algorithm a bunch of photos.
We also point out the human faces in the photos to the algorithm.
The algorithm is then given new photos (that it has never seen before).
The algorithm points out the human faces in the new photos.

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained using labeled data.
Then, the algorithm can label unlabeled data.


2) Unsupervised Learning ------------------------

example -----
We give the algorithm a bunch of photos, and nothing else.
The algorithm looks for patterns in the photos, and invents groups.
Examples of groups: photos containing humans faces; photos of ducks; and black
and white photos.

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm finds patterns in the provided data, and
invents groups. This grouping of data is known as called "clustering", and the
formed groups are called "clusters".


2) Reinforcement Learning -----------------------

example -----
We give the algorithm an encoding of a chess game. The algorithm is also given a
function that measure how well it's doing in the chess game. The algorithm spits
out an effective sequence of chess moves.

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm is given an encoding of some system,
and a function that measures the algorithm's performance in the system. The
algorithm uses the given encoding and function to figure out the (almost) best
sequence of actions to take.
